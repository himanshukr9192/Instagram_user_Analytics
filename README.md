Approach

The approach is simple as we are going to use the sql command to use the database as tables and the extract the insights from the database through various commands.


A) Marketing: The marketing team wants to launch some campaigns,

Rewarding Most Loyal Users: People who have been using the platform for the longest time.
Task: The 5 oldest users of the Instagram from the database provided

Remind Inactive Users to Start Posting: By sending them promotional emails to post their 1st photo.
Task: the users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram

Declaring Contest Winner: The team started a contest and the user who gets the most likes on a single photo will win the contest now they wish to declare the winner.
Task: Identifying the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team

Hashtag Researching: A partner brand wants to know, which hashtags to use in the post to reach the most people on the platform.
Your Task: Identify and suggest the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on the platform

Launch AD Campaign: The team wants to know, which day would be the best day to launch ADs.
Task: What day of the week do most users register on? The insights on when to schedule an ad campaign


B) Investor Metrics: Our investors want to know if Instagram is performing well and is not becoming redundant like Facebook, they want to assess the app on the following grounds

User Engagement: Are users still as active and post on Instagram or they are making fewer posts
Task: How many times does the average user posts on Instagram. Also, the total number of photos on Instagram/total number of users.

Bots & Fake Accounts: The investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts
Task: The data of theb users(bots) who have liked every single photo on the site (since any normal user would not be able to do this).
